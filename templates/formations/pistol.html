      <h3>What is the Pistol Formation?</h3>
      <p>The <strong>Pistol Formation</strong> is a hybrid offensive alignment that combines elements of both the
        traditional shotgun and under-center formations. In the pistol, the quarterback lines up about 3–4 yards
        behind the center — closer than in a standard shotgun formation — with a running back directly behind the quarterback.
        This setup allows the offense to blend quick passing plays with a strong downhill running game,
        giving it incredible versatility.
        First popularized byCoach Chris Ault at the University of Nevada in the mid-2000s,
        the pistol has since made its way into both college and professional football.

      <h3>Key Features of the Pistol Formation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Quarterback Depth:</strong> The QB stands closer to the line of scrimmage than in a shotgun, making handoffs quicker and making it easier to sell play-action fakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Running Back Alignment:</strong> The RB lines up about <strong>2–3 yards</strong> directly behind the quarterback, allowing for a full-speed, downhill run.</li>
        <li><strong>Balanced Attack:</strong> Teams can run a strong rushing attack or execute quick passes without tipping their hand pre-snap.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatility for Mobile Quarterbacks:</strong> Ideal for option plays, read-options, RPOs, and bootlegs.</li>
      </ul>

        <h3>Pistol Variations</h3>
        <p>The Pistol Formation has a couple variations that are tracked by the scout app, they both involve
          putting an extra player in the backfield, most often a Fullback (FB). The extra FB are lined up on
          either side of the QB to act as an extra blocker or player that could be handed the ball run. A FB
          on one side of the QB is called a <strong>Pistol Strong</strong> and a FB lined up on both sides
          of the QB is called a <strong>Pistol Full</strong>

      <h3>Why Teams Use the Pistol</h3>
      <p>The Pistol Formation solves a problem: it lets offenses keep a strong run threat <em>without</em>
        forcing the quarterback to turn his back to the defense,
        as he would in traditional under-center sets. This keeps the QB in a better position to read the defense,
        especially for quick throws. <br>
        This allows the offense to: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Be unpredictable</li>
        <li>Run a broader range of plays</li>
        <li>Put extra pressure on linebackers and safeties</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
      <p>The Pistol Formation is  about balance, speed, and unpredictability.
        It blends the best parts of old-school power football with the modern spread passing game —
        and when executed well, it can be difficult to defend.
      </p>
      <p>Whether you're a coach, player, or fan, understanding the pistol helps you see how today’s
        offenses are evolving to stay one step ahead of the defense.
