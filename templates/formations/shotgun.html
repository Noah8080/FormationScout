      <h3>What is the Shotgun Formation?</h3>
      <p>The <strong>Shotgun Formation</strong> is a classic offensive alignment where the quarterback lines up about 5–7 yards behind the center at the snap.
        This setup gives the quarterback more time to see the defense and make quick decisions, especially for passing plays.
        Originally popularized in professional football in the 1960s by coaches like Tom Landry of the Dallas Cowboys,
        the shotgun has become a staple at all levels of football due to its flexibility and effectiveness in the passing game.

      <h3>Key Features of the Shotgun Formation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Quarterback Depth:</strong> The QB stands farther back (5–7 yards) allowing for more time to process the defense and set up passing plays.</li>
        <li><strong>Emphasis on Passing:</strong> The shotgun is primarily used to aid the passing game by giving the QB a clear view of the defense.</li>
        <li><strong>Running Game Options:</strong> Despite its reputation, teams can still run the ball effectively out of the shotgun with draws, RPOs, and zone-read plays.</li>
        <li><strong>Wide Formations:</strong> Often paired with multiple wide receivers to stretch the defense horizontally and create mismatches.</li>
      </ul>

        <h3>Shotgun Variations</h3>
        <p>The Shotgun Formation has a couple variations that are tracked by the scout app, they are the traditional
          look shown above and <strong>Shotgun Max</strong>, which is when the QB has an RB on both of his sides.
          This is often done to provide extra pass protection on passing plays or create more deception by adding
          another player the QB could hand the ball off to on running plays.

      <h3>Why Teams Use the Shotgun</h3>
      <p>The Shotgun Formation gives offenses a major advantage by improving the quarterback’s ability to read the defense and react quickly.
        With the QB already set deeper, the offense can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Attack defenses with quick, short passes</li>
        <li>Stretch the field both horizontally and vertically</li>
        <li>Improve protection against blitzes and pressure</li>
        <li>Utilize the quarterback as a running threat on draws and read-options</li>
      </ul>
