      <h3>What is the I Formation?</h3>
      <p>The <strong>I Formation</strong> is one of the most classic and recognizable offensive alignments in football.
        In the I, the quarterback lines up under center, with a fullback positioned directly behind the QB,
        and a running back (tailback) lined up behind the fullback — forming a straight line resembling the letter "I".
        The I Formation emphasizes power running and play-action passing, making it a staple at all levels of football for decades.

      <h3>Key Features of the I Formation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Quarterback Under Center:</strong> The QB is directly behind the center for quicker handoffs and fakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Fullback and Tailback:</strong> The fullback acts as a lead blocker, while the tailback is the primary ball carrier.</li>
        <li><strong>Power Running Game:</strong> The formation is built for north-south, between-the-tackles running.</li>
        <li><strong>Play-Action Capability:</strong> Defenses expecting the run can be easily fooled by play-action passes downfield.</li>
      </ul>

        <h3>I Formation Variations</h3>
        <p>The I Formation has multiple variants that adjust personnel or alignments to create different looks.
          Two common variations tracked by the scout app are <strong>Offset I</strong> and <strong>Power I</strong>.
          Offset I shifts the fullback a couple yards to either side of the line and Power I adds another Fullback to
          the backfield.
        </p>
