      <h2  style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;" >The Singleback Formation</h2>

      <h3>What is the Singleback Formation?</h3>
      <p>The <strong>Singleback Formation</strong> is a versatile offensive alignment where the quarterback lines up under center,
        and there is only one running back positioned several yards behind the quarterback — with no fullback.
        By removing the fullback, the offense can spread out the defense with extra wide receivers or tight ends while still maintaining a strong running threat.
        The Singleback became especially popular in the NFL during the late 1980s and early 1990s,
        notably used by coaches like Joe Gibbs and Mike Shanahan to balance the passing and running game.

      <h3>Key Features of the Singleback Formation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Quarterback Under Center:</strong> The QB lines up directly behind the center, giving quicker access to handing off the ball or executing play-action.</li>
        <li><strong>One Running Back:</strong> A lone running back lines up about 5–7 yards behind the quarterback, with no fullback in the backfield.</li>
        <li><strong>Spread Possibilities:</strong> By eliminating the fullback, teams can bring extra receivers or tight ends onto the field, spreading the defense wider.</li>
        <li><strong>Play-Action Threat:</strong> The formation is perfect for setting up convincing play-action passes that freeze linebackers and safeties.</li>
      </ul>

        <h3>Singleback Variations</h3>
        <p>The Singleback Formation has several variations based on personnel and formation shifts.
          Two common versions tracked by the scout app are <strong>Singleback Ace</strong> and <strong>Singleback Trips</strong>.
          These variants either use multiple tight ends or overload one side of the formation with receivers. In the Ace
          a receiver is added to both the top and bottom of the formation. In the Trips a combination of tight ends and
          receivers are added to the same side of the line making a triangle shape.
          This application only detects backfield formations and will not specify between the two.

        <li>Keep defenses guessing between run and pass</li>
        <li>Enhance protection with tight ends while still spreading the field</li>
        <li>Use the entire width of the field for creative play designs</li>
      </ul>
